# Scheduling Desktop Application

## Introduction
Welcome to my Scheduling Desktop Application project! This is a C# application I've built to handle a variety of business needs, much like those encountered in real-world software development. This application showcases my ability to create robust, functional software solutions and serves as a valuable piece in my portfolio.

This README provides an overview of the project, including its features, requirements, and instructions for setup and usage.

## Scenario
I developed this application for a global consulting organization with offices in Phoenix, Arizona; New York, New York; and London, England. The application interacts with a provided MySQL database, pulling data without modifying the database structure. The goal was to create a user-friendly, multilingual application that meets specific business requirements.

## Requirements
The application is built in C# using the .NET Framework and Visual Studio IDE. It includes:
- A login form with location detection and multilingual support.
- Functionality to add, update, and delete customer records.
- Functionality to add, update, and delete appointments.
- A calendar view feature.
- Time zone and daylight saving time adjustments for appointments.
- Alerts for upcoming appointments.
- Report generation capabilities.
- Logging of user login activities.

## Features
### Login Form
- **Location Detection**: Determines the user's location.
- **Multilingual Support**: Translates login and error messages into English and one additional language.
- **Authentication**: Verifies username and password ("test" for both).

### Customer Management
- **Add, Update, Delete**: Manage customer records with name, address, and phone number fields.
- **Validation**: Ensures fields are trimmed, non-empty, and phone numbers allow only digits and dashes.
- **Exception Handling**: Handles errors during add, update, and delete operations.

### Appointment Management
- **Add, Update, Delete**: Manage appointments linked to customer records.
- **Validation**: Ensures appointments are scheduled during business hours (9:00 AM - 5:00 PM, Mondayâ€“Friday, EST) and prevents overlapping appointments.
- **Exception Handling**: Handles errors during add, update, and delete operations.
